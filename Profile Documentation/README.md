# DocGen: a generic approach for automated documentation generation from MagicDraw models

DocGen is a product of NASA JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), one of the leaders in MBSE (Model-Based Systems Engineering) technology.

They initiated this project for supporting automated documentation generation scenarios, whose basis is typically a set of SysML models in MagicDraw.

# Installing DocGen

* DocGen comes packaged with OpenMBEE's [Model Development Kit (MDK)](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk); follow the instructions there.

# Profile Documentation

The meaning of each stereotype in the Arrowhead SysML Profile is provided in the Documentation field within MagicDraw. We use DocGen for automatically extracting those into a table conforming to the well-known [DocBook XML schema](https://docbook.org/). A HTML version (converted from DocBook with the very useful [Pandoc tool](https://pandoc.org/)) is available in this folder.
