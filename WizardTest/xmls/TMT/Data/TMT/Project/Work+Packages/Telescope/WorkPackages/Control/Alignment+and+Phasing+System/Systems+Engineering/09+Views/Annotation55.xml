<eAnnotations source="This use case can be executed anytime during the night, but no sooner then ~40 minutes (TBD) after sunset. Stars would usually selected to be ~1 hour to 30 minutes East at a Declination of 0 or 40 degrees in order to minimize changes in telescope elevation. The typical telescope elevation angle will be 70 degrees and will vary by less then a few degrees over the 30 minutes it takes to execute this use case. If this use case is being used for alignment at a elevation angle other then 70 degrees, then by selecting stars at the appropriate Declination the change in telescope elevation angle can be minimized to be similar to that used for the 70 degree elevation angle alignment. The specific required star magnitudes and colors for this test are between 5th and 6th magnitude (TBR). In practice we have never had problems finding stars at Keck in this magnitude range so donâ€™t expect any problems with APS at TMT." references="#//TMT/Project/Work%20Packages/Telescope/WorkPackages/Control/Alignment%20and%20Phasing%20System/Systems%20Engineering/09%20Views"/>
