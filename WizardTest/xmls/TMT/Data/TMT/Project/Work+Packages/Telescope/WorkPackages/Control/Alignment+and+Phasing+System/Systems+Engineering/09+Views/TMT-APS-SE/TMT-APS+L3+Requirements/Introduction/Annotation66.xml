&lt;p&gt;This document will show the&amp;nbsp;APS L3 requirements for each of the sub-assemblies of APS. It will also contain the requirements flow up to L2. All of this is done in SysML and exported through a web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L2 APS, which is maintained in DOORS by TMT is syncronized with our SysML model through RedIF files. Those are documented in the TMT-APS Requirements Flowdown document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier sections of the document will eventually have explanation of how these requirements came about and may also contain some of the breakdown of for example Mass, Power, and throughput requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual sets of L3 requirements will be in tables in later chapters. For now, we only have the L3 APT ones. The first table shows the requirement ID, Name, Text, Description, and Refines (which are the parents at L2). The second table lists the ID, Name, SE Notes, and APS Notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
