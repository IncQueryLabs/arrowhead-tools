dependencies, competing characterizations

1) original block hierarchy H
1.a) apply inheritance pattern to H
1.b) create deep copy of H, H'
      apply inheritance pattern to H'
1.c) BST H into H''
      apply inheritance pattern to H''

Where to put values?
- redefine all value properties from facet and populate default values
- create for analysis an instance tree and populate slots

2) create instance tree of H
2.b) apply multi-classification to instance
need a script which understands the dependency characterization
and created multi-classification to instance base don dependency
