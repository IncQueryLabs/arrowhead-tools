## Purpose and Usage

This plugin is suitable for addressing deployment-layer information in isolation, or even integrated with an SoS model created in the [https://github.com/IncQueryLabs/arrowhead-tools-magicdraw-plugins/tree/master/SoS%20Deployment%20Plugin](SoS Design Plugin).

The primary conceptual addition of the plugin is a SysML profile refelcting _Vortolang_, the modeling language (DSL) at the heart of [Eclipse Vorto](https://eclipse.org/vorto/). 
The main feature of the plugin is an import functionality, allowing for browsing the Vorto device digital twin catalogue and importing its entries into MagicDraw in a native SysML format. 
In an integrated usage scenario, the imported model can be used for _platform modeling_: while the SoS design can be thought of as _platform-independent_, its _allocation_ to 
Vorto device instances represents a _platform-specific_ blueprint of an Arrowhead SoS.

## Installation

See the README for the [https://github.com/IncQueryLabs/arrowhead-tools-magicdraw-plugins/tree/master/SoS%20Deployment%20Plugin](SoS Design Plugin).
