### Creating a new project

1. Create a normal SysML project (File -> New Project -> Systems Engineering -> SysML Project)
2. Import the profile (File -> Use Project -> Use Local Project). Either:
    * Use the *From file system* option
      * The connnection may break if the file containing the profile is moved
    * Put said file next to the new project and use the *From predefined location* -> *<project.dir>* option
      * And move the two of the togeter (the .bak created is just a backup file)
3. Press finish
